# Hello World

Welcome to my blog `inline code`

In this blog post, we will explore the amazing features of Next.js and why it's a great choice for building modern web applications.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that allows you to build server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated websites. It provides a seamless development experience with features like automatic code splitting, hot module replacement, and server-side rendering out of the box.

## Benefits of Next.js

- **Improved Performance**: Next.js optimizes your application for performance by automatically splitting your code and serving only what's necessary for each page.

- **SEO-friendly**: With server-side rendering, Next.js ensures that search engines can easily crawl and index your website, improving its visibility in search results.

- **Simplified Routing**: Next.js comes with a built-in routing system that makes it easy to create dynamic and nested routes without any additional configuration.

- **Static Site Generation**: Next.js allows you to generate static HTML files at build time, which can be deployed to a CDN for lightning-fast performance.

## Getting Started with Next.js

To get started with Next.js, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Next.js globally by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g next
   ```

2. Create a new Next.js project by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app my-blog
   ```

3. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my-blog
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your Next.js application in action.

That's it! You're now ready to start building your Next.js blog.

Stay tuned for more exciting content on Next.js in future blog posts!

Happy coding!
